# Manhattan Distance
	Manhattan distance is the distance between two points in a grid (like the grid-like street geography of the New York borough of Manhattan) 
	calculated by only taking a vertical and/or horizontal path.

	Write a function int manhattanDistance(Point, Point) that returns the Manhattan Distance between the two points.

# Potential constraints
	The class Point is immutable
	The class Point has no Getters, no Setters
	The class Point has no public properties (i.e. the internal state cannot be read from outside the class).

# Suggested tests
	manhattanDistance( Point(1, 1), Point(1, 1) ) should returns 0
	manhattanDistance( Point(5, 4), Point(3, 2) ) should returns 4
	manhattanDistance( Point(1, 1), Point(0, 3) ) should returns 3
